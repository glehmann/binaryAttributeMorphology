\begin{abstract}
\noindent
Labelizing the objects in an image is a very common task in image analysis. It can be done manually,
after a binarization, or can be produced directly by some algorithms, like the watershed transform.
Manipulating those objects can be very useful, to get some informations about them for example, or
to remove some of them according to those informations.
This article describes some new classes made to represent and manipulate the labeled objects within
ITK.
